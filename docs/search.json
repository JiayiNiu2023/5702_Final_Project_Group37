    "text": "2.1 Description\nOur dataset was meticulously constructed through a multi-step process combining data from the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) DataMapper platform (https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/datasets) and the United Nations classification databases. The economic indicators were initially downloaded as separate Excel files from the IMF, including GDP Growth, GDP Per Capita, Unemployment rates, Inflation rates, Population statistics, Current Account balances, and Government Debt levels, all covering the period from 2018 to 2023. The data processing began with standardizing country names across all files and removing regional aggregates to focus on country-level analysis. We then used VLOOKUP functions in Excel to merge data from different files and combined all separate sheets into a single Excel workbook. A crucial step involved manually correcting the development status classifications due to inconsistencies in country naming conventions between IMF and UN datasets. Throughout this process, we encountered and addressed several challenges, including inconsistent country naming conventions, missing data points (particularly for developing nations), and varying data availability across different time periods and indicators. Rather than imputing values, we preserved original “no data” entries to maintain data integrity. The final dataset encompasses information for 194 countries, though coverage varies by indicator and year, providing a comprehensive yet transparent view of global economic indicators that acknowledges data limitations and gaps. The IMF updates this data semi-annually, while the UN classifications are updated annually, ensuring our analysis reflects recent global economic trends while maintaining consistent categorical classifications.",

In contrast, the Middle East experienced negative growth at -5.4%, entirely from its developing economies.\nEurope showed modest growth at 3.1%, with developed economies contributing 1.4% and developing economies slightly higher at 1.7%. Oceania performed slightly better, with a total growth of 4%, split between 1.3% from developed economies and 2.7% from developing economies. North America recorded 5.2% growth overall, with 2.0% coming from developed economies and 3.2% from developing ones.\nAfrica and South America, made up entirely of developing economies, reported steady growth rates of 3.7% and 4.3%, respectively. Meanwhile, the “Other” category also performed well, growing by 5.3%, solely from developing economies. The data highlights some interesting patterns. While many regions rely heavily on either developed or developing economies, others like Asia show a mix, with its strong overall growth largely driven by its developed economies.

This stark contrast between regions led us to a deeper dive into the historical trends through time series analysis.\nThe time series analysis revealed the severe economic impact of COVID-19 in 2020, which caused significant contractions across most regions. Europe, the Middle East, and the “Other” category were among the hardest hit during this period. However, recovery patterns differed widely. Asia showcased exceptional resilience, with both its developed and developing economies maintaining stable growth through the post-pandemic years. Europe, while rebounding strongly in 2021, saw its growth stabilize at a lower rate in subsequent years. North America displayed a slower, steadier recovery, with both developed and developing economies following a gradual upward trajectory.\nThe analysis also highlighted clear differences between developed and developing economies. Developed economies (depicted by blue lines) generally experienced lower but more stable growth rates. In contrast, developing economies (shown in orange lines) were characterized by higher volatility but also greater growth potential. This distinction was particularly pronounced in South America’s performance, where developing economies demonstrated notable growth following the pandemic.",

The ridge density plots provide valuable insights into how debt distributions have evolved across regions over time.\nEurope consistently exhibits the widest spread in government debt levels, with a distinct bimodal distribution suggesting two clusters of countries with differing debt strategies. This pattern remains largely stable throughout the period, although a marked increase in overall debt levels is evident post-2020, likely due to pandemic-related fiscal measures. South America shows high variability in government debt levels, with a wide and increasingly dispersed distribution after 2020. The long right tails indicate a few countries with exceptionally high debt levels, reflecting significant outliers in the region’s fiscal landscape.\nAsia displays a more concentrated debt distribution, with most countries falling within a moderate debt range. However, some outliers with very high debt levels are evident, as highlighted by the right tails in the distributions, signaling unique cases of heavy borrowing. Africa demonstrates relatively lower average debt levels compared to other regions, with a fairly consistent distribution throughout the period. After 2020, however, the distribution begins to widen slightly, suggesting growing diversity in debt levels across African nations.\nThe Middle East has one of the most compact debt distributions, with little year-to-year variability. This consistency indicates that the government has tighter control over its debt than other regions. A notable trend across all regions is a clear shift in debt distributions around 2020, which corresponds to the global economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most regions experienced an increase in debt levels and distributions following this period, reflecting widespread increases in government borrowing to address the crisis. We can describe the various approaches and challenges that regions face when managing government debt in the aftermath of global economic disruptions.",

Most countries cluster within the 0-4% growth range, particularly 2-4%, with average debt levels around 60-70% of GDP (indicated by pink/purple bars). High debt levels (over 150% of GDP) appear across various growth ranges, showing that high debt does not always equate to low growth; for example, some Asian countries sustain strong growth with substantial debt, while certain European nations maintain stable growth despite high debt levels. Lower-growth regions (-2-0%) tend to have slightly higher average debt, but this trend is not uniform—African nations often achieve higher growth with lower debt, whereas European countries display moderate growth alongside higher debt burdens. Outliers in extreme growth ranges (below -6% or above 8%) often reflect unique economic conditions rather than typical debt-growth relationships. While there is a mild negative association between debt and growth, the relationship is complex and shaped by regional context and economic structure, challenging the assumption that high debt universally inhibits growth.\n\n\nCode\n# library(ggplot2)\n# library(dplyr)\n# library(tidyr)\n# library(gganimate)\n# \n# # Reshape the data for multiple years\n# gdp_income_data_long &lt;- data |&gt;\n#   select(Country, Region, Status, \n#          starts_with(\"Population\"), starts_with(\"GDP_Growth\"), starts_with(\"GDP_Per_Capi\")) |&gt;\n#   pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"GDP_Growth\"), \n#                names_to = \"Year\", values_to = \"GDP_Growth\") |&gt;\n#   mutate(Year = gsub(\"GDP_Growth_\", \"\", Year)) |&gt;\n#   pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"GDP_Per_Capi\"), \n#                names_to = \"Year_Per_Capi\", values_to = \"GDP_Per_Capi\") |&gt;\n#   filter(Year == gsub(\"GDP_Per_Capi_\", \"\", Year_Per_Capi)) |&gt;\n#   pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"Population\"), \n#                names_to = \"Year_Population\", values_to = \"Population\") |&gt;\n#   filter(Year == gsub(\"Population_\", \"\", Year_Population)) |&gt;\n#   select(-Year_Per_Capi, -Year_Population) |&gt;\n#   mutate(across(c(GDP_Growth, GDP_Per_Capi), \n#                 ~ as.numeric(ifelse(. == \"no data\", NA, .)))) |&gt;\n#   filter(complete.cases(.)) # Remove rows with missing data\n# \n# # Pre-calculate regression lines for each Region and Year\n# trend_lines &lt;- gdp_income_data_long |&gt;\n#   group_by(Region, Year) |&gt;\n#   do({\n#     model &lt;- lm(GDP_Per_Capi ~ GDP_Growth, data = .)\n#     data.frame(\n#       GDP_Growth = seq(min(.$GDP_Growth, na.rm = TRUE), \n#                        max(.$GDP_Growth, na.rm = TRUE), length.out = 100),\n#       GDP_Per_Capi = predict(model, newdata = data.frame(GDP_Growth = seq(min(.$GDP_Growth, na.rm = TRUE), \n#                                                                          max(.$GDP_Growth, na.rm = TRUE), length.out = 100))),\n#       Year = unique(.$Year), # Add Year\n#       Region = unique(.$Region) # Add Region\n#     )\n#   }) |&gt;\n#   ungroup()\n# \n# # Animated plot with pre-calculated trend lines\n# animated_trend &lt;- ggplot() +\n#   geom_line(data = trend_lines, aes(x = GDP_Growth, \n#                                     y = GDP_Per_Capi, \n#                                     color = Region, \n#                                     group = Region), size = 1.2) +\n#   scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set1\") +\n#   scale_x_continuous(name = \"GDP Growth Rate (%)\") +\n#   scale_y_continuous(name = \"GDP Per Capita (USD)\") +\n#   labs(\n#     title = \"Trends in GDP Growth vs. Per Capita Income Over Time\",\n#     subtitle = \"Year: {closest_state}\",\n#     color = \"Region\"\n#   ) +\n#   theme_minimal() +\n#   theme(\n#     plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n#     plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5),\n#     axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n#     legend.position = \"right\",\n#     legend.title = element_text(size = 11),\n#     legend.text = element_text(size = 10)\n#   ) +\n#   transition_states(Year, transition_length = 2, state_length = 1) +\n#   ease_aes('cubic-in-out')\n# \n# # Render the animation\n# animate(animated_trend, nframes = 100, fps = 10, width = 800, height = 600, renderer = gifski_renderer())\n# \n# # Save the animation as a GIF\n# anim_save(\"gdp_trend_lines_fixed.gif\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\neconomic_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  select(Country, Region, Status, \n         GDP_Growth_2023, Government_Debt_2023, \n         Inflation_Rate_2023) %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(c(GDP_Growth_2023, Government_Debt_2023, Inflation_Rate_2023), \n                ~as.numeric(ifelse(. == \"no data\", NA, .)))) %&gt;%\n  na.omit()\n\npca_data &lt;- economic_data %&gt;%\n  select(GDP_Growth_2023, Government_Debt_2023, Inflation_Rate_2023) %&gt;%\n  scale()\n\npca_results &lt;- PCA(pca_data, graph = FALSE)\n\nbiplot_data &lt;- economic_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    PC1 = pca_results$ind$coord[, 1],\n    PC2 = pca_results$ind$coord[, 2]\n  )\n\nvar_coords &lt;- as.data.frame(pca_results$var$coord) %&gt;%\n  select(Dim.1, Dim.2) %&gt;%\n  rownames_to_column(\"Variable\")\n\nggplot(biplot_data, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Status), size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_segment(data = var_coords,\n               aes(x = 0, y = 0, xend = Dim.1 * 3, yend = Dim.2 * 3),\n               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, \"cm\")),\n               color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_text(data = var_coords,\n            aes(x = Dim.1 * 3.2, y = Dim.2 * 3.2, label = Variable),\n            color = \"blue\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text(data = filter(biplot_data, \n                         abs(PC1) &gt;
