    "text": "2.1 Description\nOur dataset was meticulously constructed through a multi-step process combining data from the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) DataMapper platform (https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/datasets) and the United Nations classification databases. The economic indicators were initially downloaded as separate Excel files from the IMF, including GDP Growth, GDP Per Capita, Unemployment rates, Inflation rates, Population statistics, Current Account balances, and Government Debt levels, all covering the period from 2018 to 2023. The data processing began with standardizing country names across all files and removing regional aggregates to focus on country-level analysis. We then used VLOOKUP functions in Excel to merge data from different files and combined all separate sheets into a single Excel workbook. A crucial step involved manually correcting the development status classifications due to inconsistencies in country naming conventions between IMF and UN datasets. Throughout this process, we encountered and addressed several challenges, including inconsistent country naming conventions, missing data points (particularly for developing nations), and varying data availability across different time periods and indicators. Rather than imputing values, we preserved original “no data” entries to maintain data integrity. The final dataset encompasses information for 194 countries, though coverage varies by indicator and year, providing a comprehensive yet transparent view of global economic indicators that acknowledges data limitations and gaps. The IMF updates this data semi-annually, while the UN classifications are updated annually, ensuring our analysis reflects recent global economic trends while maintaining consistent categorical classifications.",

In contrast, the Middle East experienced negative growth at -5.4%, entirely from its developing economies.\nEurope showed modest growth at 3.1%, with developed economies contributing 1.4% and developing economies slightly higher at 1.7%. Oceania performed slightly better, with a total growth of 4%, split between 1.3% from developed economies and 2.7% from developing economies. North America recorded 5.2% growth overall, with 2.0% coming from developed economies and 3.2% from developing ones.\nAfrica and South America, made up entirely of developing economies, reported steady growth rates of 3.7% and 4.3%, respectively. Meanwhile, the “Other” category also performed well, growing by 5.3%, solely from developing economies. The data highlights some interesting patterns. While many regions rely heavily on either developed or developing economies, others like Asia show a mix, with its strong overall growth largely driven by its developed economies. This is notable, as developing economies are typically the ones with higher growth rates.",

This stark contrast between regions led us to a deeper dive into the historical trends through time series analysis.\nThe time series analysis revealed the severe economic impact of COVID-19 in 2020, which caused significant contractions across most regions. Europe, the Middle East, and the “Other” category were among the hardest hit during this period. However, recovery patterns differed widely. Asia showcased exceptional resilience, with both its developed and developing economies maintaining stable growth through the post-pandemic years. Europe, while rebounding strongly in 2021, saw its growth stabilize at a lower rate in subsequent years. North America displayed a slower, steadier recovery, with both developed and developing economies following a gradual upward trajectory.\nThe analysis also highlighted clear differences between developed and developing economies. Developed economies (depicted by blue lines) generally experienced lower but more stable growth rates. In contrast, developing economies (shown in orange lines) were characterized by higher volatility but also greater growth potential. This distinction was particularly pronounced in South America’s performance, where developing economies demonstrated notable growth following the pandemic.",

The ridge density plots provide valuable insights into how debt distributions have evolved across regions over time.\nEurope consistently exhibits the widest spread in government debt levels, with a distinct bimodal distribution suggesting two clusters of countries with differing debt strategies. This pattern remains largely stable throughout the period, although a marked increase in overall debt levels is evident post-2020, likely due to pandemic-related fiscal measures. South America shows high variability in government debt levels, with a wide and increasingly dispersed distribution after 2020. The long right tails indicate a few countries with exceptionally high debt levels, reflecting significant outliers in the region’s fiscal landscape.\nAsia displays a more concentrated debt distribution, with most countries falling within a moderate debt range. However, some outliers with very high debt levels are evident, as highlighted by the right tails in the distributions, signaling unique cases of heavy borrowing. Africa demonstrates relatively lower average debt levels compared to other regions, with a fairly consistent distribution throughout the period. After 2020, however, the distribution begins to widen slightly, suggesting growing diversity in debt levels across African nations.\nThe Middle East has one of the most compact debt distributions, with little year-to-year variability. This consistency indicates that the government has tighter control over its debt than other regions. A notable trend across all regions is a clear shift in debt distributions around 2020, which corresponds to the global economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most regions experienced an increase in debt levels and distributions following this period, reflecting widespread increases in government borrowing to address the crisis. We can describe the various approaches and challenges that regions face when managing government debt in the aftermath of global economic disruptions.",

Most countries cluster within the 0-4% growth range, particularly 2-4%, with average debt levels around 60-70% of GDP (indicated by pink/purple bars). High debt levels (over 150% of GDP) appear across various growth ranges, showing that high debt does not always equate to low growth; for example, some Asian countries sustain strong growth with substantial debt, while certain European nations maintain stable growth despite high debt levels. Lower-growth regions (-2-0%) tend to have slightly higher average debt, but this trend is not uniform—African nations often achieve higher growth with lower debt, whereas European countries display moderate growth alongside higher debt burdens. Outliers in extreme growth ranges (below -6% or above 8%) often reflect unique economic conditions rather than typical debt-growth relationships. While there is a mild negative association between debt and growth, the relationship is complex and shaped by regional context and economic structure, challenging the assumption that high debt universally inhibits growth.\n\n\nCode\n# library(ggplot2)\n# library(dplyr)\n# library(tidyr)\n# library(gganimate)\n# \n# # Reshape the data for multiple years\n# gdp_income_data_long &lt;- data |&gt;\n#   select(Country, Region, Status, \n#          starts_with(\"Population\"), starts_with(\"GDP_Growth\"), starts_with(\"GDP_Per_Capi\")) |&gt;\n#   pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"GDP_Growth\"), \n#                names_to = \"Year\", values_to = \"GDP_Growth\") |&gt;\n#   mutate(Year = gsub(\"GDP_Growth_\", \"\", Year)) |&gt;\n#   pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"GDP_Per_Capi\"), \n#                names_to = \"Year_Per_Capi\", values_to = \"GDP_Per_Capi\") |&gt;\n#   filter(Year == gsub(\"GDP_Per_Capi_\", \"\", Year_Per_Capi)) |&gt;\n#   pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"Population\"), \n#                names_to = \"Year_Population\", values_to = \"Population\") |&gt;\n#   filter(Year == gsub(\"Population_\", \"\", Year_Population)) |&gt;\n#   select(-Year_Per_Capi, -Year_Population) |&gt;\n#   mutate(across(c(GDP_Growth, GDP_Per_Capi), \n#                 ~ as.numeric(ifelse(. == \"no data\", NA, .)))) |&gt;\n#   filter(complete.cases(.)) # Remove rows with missing data\n# \n# # Pre-calculate regression lines for each Region and Year\n# trend_lines &lt;- gdp_income_data_long |&gt;\n#   group_by(Region, Year) |&gt;\n#   do({\n#     model &lt;- lm(GDP_Per_Capi ~ GDP_Growth, data = .)\n#     data.frame(\n#       GDP_Growth = seq(min(.$GDP_Growth, na.rm = TRUE), \n#                        max(.$GDP_Growth, na.rm = TRUE), length.out = 100),\n#       GDP_Per_Capi = predict(model, newdata = data.frame(GDP_Growth = seq(min(.$GDP_Growth, na.rm = TRUE), \n#                                                                          max(.$GDP_Growth, na.rm = TRUE), length.out = 100))),\n#       Year = unique(.$Year), # Add Year\n#       Region = unique(.$Region) # Add Region\n#     )\n#   }) |&gt;\n#   ungroup()\n# \n# # Animated plot with pre-calculated trend lines\n# animated_trend &lt;- ggplot() +\n#   geom_line(data = trend_lines, aes(x = GDP_Growth, \n#                                     y = GDP_Per_Capi, \n#                                     color = Region, \n#                                     group = Region), size = 1.2) +\n#   scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set1\") +\n#   scale_x_continuous(name = \"GDP Growth Rate (%)\") +\n#   scale_y_continuous(name = \"GDP Per Capita (USD)\") +\n#   labs(\n#     title = \"Trends in GDP Growth vs. Per Capita Income Over Time\",\n#     subtitle = \"Year: {closest_state}\",\n#     color = \"Region\"\n#   ) +\n#   theme_minimal() +\n#   theme(\n#     plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n#     plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5),\n#     axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n#     legend.position = \"right\",\n#     legend.title = element_text(size = 11),\n#     legend.text = element_text(size = 10)\n#   ) +\n#   transition_states(Year, transition_length = 2, state_length = 1) +\n#   ease_aes('cubic-in-out')\n# \n# # Render the animation\n# animate(animated_trend, nframes = 100, fps = 10, width = 800, height = 600, renderer = gifski_renderer())\n# \n# # Save the animation as a GIF\n# anim_save(\"gdp_trend_lines_fixed.gif\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\neconomic_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  select(Country, Region, Status, \n         GDP_Growth_2023, Government_Debt_2023, \n         Inflation_Rate_2023) %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(c(GDP_Growth_2023, Government_Debt_2023, Inflation_Rate_2023), \n                ~as.numeric(ifelse(. == \"no data\", NA, .)))) %&gt;%\n  na.omit()\n\npca_data &lt;- economic_data %&gt;%\n  select(GDP_Growth_2023, Government_Debt_2023, Inflation_Rate_2023) %&gt;%\n  scale()\n\npca_results &lt;- PCA(pca_data, graph = FALSE)\n\nbiplot_data &lt;- economic_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    PC1 = pca_results$ind$coord[, 1],\n    PC2 = pca_results$ind$coord[, 2]\n  )\n\nvar_coords &lt;- as.data.frame(pca_results$var$coord) %&gt;%\n  select(Dim.1, Dim.2) %&gt;%\n  rownames_to_column(\"Variable\")\n\nggplot(biplot_data, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Status), size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_segment(data = var_coords,\n               aes(x = 0, y = 0, xend = Dim.1 * 3, yend = Dim.2 * 3),\n               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, \"cm\")),\n               color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_text(data = var_coords,\n            aes(x = Dim.1 * 3.2, y = Dim.2 * 3.2, label = Variable),\n            color = \"blue\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text(data = filter(biplot_data, \n                         abs(PC1) &gt;

This stark contrast between regions led us to a deeper dive into the historical trends through time series analysis.\nThe time series analysis revealed the severe economic impact of COVID-19 in 2020, which caused significant contractions across most regions. Europe, the Middle East, and the “Other” category were among the hardest hit during this period. However, recovery patterns differed widely. Asia showcased exceptional resilience, with both its developed and developing economies maintaining stable growth through the post-pandemic years. Europe, while rebounding strongly in 2021, saw its growth stabilize at a lower rate in subsequent years. North America displayed a slower, steadier recovery, with both developed and developing economies following a gradual upward trajectory.\nThe analysis also highlighted clear differences between developed and developing economies. Developed economies (depicted by blue lines) generally experienced lower but more stable growth rates. In contrast, developing economies (shown in orange lines) were characterized by higher volatility but also greater growth potential. This distinction was particularly pronounced in South America’s performance, where developing economies demonstrated notable growth following the pandemic.",

The ridge density plots provide valuable insights into how debt distributions have evolved across regions over time.\nEurope consistently exhibits the widest spread in government debt levels, with a distinct bimodal distribution suggesting two clusters of countries with differing debt strategies. This pattern remains largely stable throughout the period, although a marked increase in overall debt levels is evident post-2020, likely due to pandemic-related fiscal measures. South America shows high variability in government debt levels, with a wide and increasingly dispersed distribution after 2020. The long right tails indicate a few countries with exceptionally high debt levels, reflecting significant outliers in the region’s fiscal landscape.\nAsia displays a more concentrated debt distribution, with most countries falling within a moderate debt range. However, some outliers with very high debt levels are evident, as highlighted by the right tails in the distributions, signaling unique cases of heavy borrowing. Africa demonstrates relatively lower average debt levels compared to other regions, with a fairly consistent distribution throughout the period. After 2020, however, the distribution begins to widen slightly, suggesting growing diversity in debt levels across African nations.\nThe Middle East has one of the most compact debt distributions, with little year-to-year variability. This consistency indicates that the government has tighter control over its debt than other regions. A notable trend across all regions is a clear shift in debt distributions around 2020, which corresponds to the global economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most regions experienced an increase in debt levels and distributions following this period, reflecting widespread increases in government borrowing to address the crisis. We can describe the various approaches and challenges that regions face when managing government debt in the aftermath of global economic disruptions.",

    "text": "3.4 Graph 4: Log-Scaled GDP Growth vs. Per Capita Income Across Regions (2022 vs 2023)\nThis shows regional variations in GDP growth against per capita income in 2023. Though their GDP per capita is usually low, African nations show great variation in growth rates, which reflect different phases of development. Typical of advanced economies, European nations are concentrated at higher income levels with steady, modest growth. Asia exhibits the most varied trends; large-population countries are showing strong development all over a wide income range.

With some high-income countries and differing rates of development, Oceania and the Middle East show erratic trends.

African countries experienced varying degrees of growth while maintaining lower overall living standards. Pretty much what you would expect.There are some interesting changes when we move to 2023. Growth rates have become more widely distributed overall, with some nations seeing much slower growth and others seeing much higher growth rates (up to almost 100% on the log scale). Although their growth rates varied more than in 2022, African nations continued to fall into the lower GDP per capita range.\nOver the course of both years, Asian nations (in blue), especially those with larger populations (shown by larger circles), remained largely stable, with some exhibiting better growth rates in 2023. The GDP per capita of European nations remained high in 2023, albeit at somewhat more cautious growth rates than in 2022. The comparison of these years indicates that, although basic regional GDP per capita trends stayed mostly stable, 2023 saw greater economic volatility and greater differences in growth rates. The continuous global economic recovery and disparate regional reactions to post-pandemic issues are probably to blame for this.",

Most countries cluster within the 0-4% growth range, particularly 2-4%, with average debt levels around 60-70% of GDP (indicated by pink/purple bars). High debt levels (over 150% of GDP) appear across various growth ranges, showing that high debt does not always equate to low growth; for example, some Asian countries sustain strong growth with substantial debt, while certain European nations maintain stable growth despite high debt levels. Lower-growth regions (-2-0%) tend to have slightly higher average debt, but this trend is not uniform—African nations often achieve higher growth with lower debt, whereas European countries display moderate growth alongside higher debt burdens. Outliers in extreme growth ranges (below -6% or above 8%) often reflect unique economic conditions rather than typical debt-growth relationships. While there is a mild negative association between debt and growth, the relationship is complex and shaped by regional context and economic structure, challenging the assumption that high debt universally inhibits growth.",

This tells an intriguing tale, particularly in relation to the COVID-19 era.\nThe most dramatic increase occurs in 2020, when the “Other” region reaches a high of 112.3 percent of GDP. South America followed a similar pattern, increasing to 92.2%, while North America reached approximately 80%. This surge in debt levels demonstrates how governments around the world responded to the pandemic with massive spending. The recovery pattern since then has been particularly interesting. Most regions show a gradual reduction in debt levels after 2020, indicating efforts to regain financial control. The “Other” region, for example, has seen its debt fall significantly from its peak of 112.3% to 78.7% by 2023.\nThroughout this time, the debt levels of Europe and Asia have remained comparatively constant, averaging 60%. At roughly 50% of GDP, the Middle East has the lowest and most stable debt profile of any region. The most conservative approach to debt management among all regions is demonstrated by Oceania, which stands out for maintaining remarkably stable debt levels even during the 2020 crisis.\nSome of the patterns of GDP growth that we have seen are put into perspective by these trends. South America and other regions that took on more debt during the pandemic appear to be having more difficulty maintaining growth. Asia and Europe, on the other hand, are exhibiting more consistent economic performance due to their more stable debt levels.",

For example, in year 2019 and 2020, the correlation between government debt in 2019 and GDP growth in 2020 are -0.36 and -0.33. This indicates that countries with higher government debt tend to experience slower GDP growth, which aligns with the economic theory that high debt burdens would constrain economic growth.\nHowever, not all years exhibit negative correlation: the correlation in year 2022 is positive and it is close to 0 in year 2021 (the value is -0.001, so it’s rounded to 0). The anomalies in these two years can be explained by the pandemic and the economic conditions after it. Due to pandemic, the government spending were implemented to recover the economy. Therefore, despite high government debt levels, more of it was for stimulating the economy and bringing it back to the normal level. Thus, it can increase GDP growth and lead to slightly positive value for correlation in year 2022.",

The parallel coordinates plot visualizes the ratio of GDP growth to government debt for European countries across six years (2018–2023).\nFrom the plot, most countries maintain relatively stable ratios between 0 and 0.2, indicating that most countries balanced economic growth with their debt levels. However, in 2020, the ratio decreases for most European countries, where many countries even have negative values. This reflects the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly reduced GDP growth for most countries though they increased government debt to help recover economy. In 2021, the economy bounced back, leading to many countries having ratio between 0.1 to 0.2, which indicated that more government debt spent on economic recovery.\nThere are certain countries consistently deviating from the general trends. For example, countries like Greece and Italy tend to have consistently lower ratios, suggesting slower economic growth for these countries. In 2020, extreme negative ratios for countries like Kosovo and Andorra indicates the disproportionate economic impact of the pandemic.",

A smaller percentage of developed nations experience inflation in the “5-10%” range, and very few exceed 10%, emphasizing their economic stability.\nOn the other hand, while about 55% of developing countries also fall into the “0-5%” range, their inflation rates are much more spread out. Unlike developed countries, a significant number of developing nations have inflation rates in the “10-15%” and “20%+” ranges. This highlights the higher inflation pressures many developing countries face, with some even grappling with hyperinflation, as shown by the “20%+” category. This disparity underscores the economic challenges that developing nations encounter compared to their more stable counterparts.",

    "text": "Our project offers a thorough examination of global economic indicators from 2018 to 2023, looking at differences between developed and developing nations. Important regional and developmental variations in GDP growth, government debt, inflation, and unemployment rates are highlighted by key findings. Developed nations usually have low inflation, steady economic growth, and controllable public debt. On the other hand, we can see that developing nations displayed more fluctuations, such as higher rates of inflation, more pronounced gaps in unemployment, and more extreme debt-to-growth ratios, suggesting a higher susceptibility to economic shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that Asia’s impressive post-pandemic recovery, Europe’s steady performance, and South America’s and the Middle East’s economic difficulties were all revealed by regional analysis and they indeed make sense in real life. It is also reasonable and logical to see that debt and growth have a complicated relationship. According to our correlation results, high debt does not always impede growth; rather, the effects vary depending on the economic structure and geographic setting. Although our analysis offers a lot valuable insights, it is limited by possible gaps in the dataset, such as incomplete or missing data for some particular countries and years. This was particularly impactful for regions with fewer countries, where each data point carries significant weight in shaping regional trends and insights. In real-world scenarios, the inclusion of these omitted data points could have revealed critical economic nuances and country-specific variations, especially in underrepresented regions. As a result, some trends and disparities may have been understated or overlooked. Addressing these limitations could lead to more nuanced findings and a richer understanding of the economic landscape across diverse global regions. In terms of lessons learned and experience gained, we believe that this project and the streamlined graph-making process improved our understanding of data visualization strategies and taught us how to select the appropriate plot types using packages to ensure that the data is displayed in a way that encourages meaningful interpretations and clarity. Furthermore, we discovered that, while visualizations were important for understanding complex relationships, creating understandable charts required careful consideration of scale, variables, and audience comprehension. These lessons will guide us to make more powerful data visualizations in the future, no matter it is academic projects or professional works, we can tell stories out of it.",
